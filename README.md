# The Code Samples of the cleantestautomation.com Membership Site

This Git repository contains the code samples of testing courses which are 
published on the [cleantestautomation.com](https://www.cleantestautomation.com) 
membership site. At the moment I am offering these courses:

* [Introduction to AssertJ-DB]() describes how you can write assertions for data that's found from a relational
   database. 
* [Introduction to JUnit 5](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5) 
  helps you get started with JUnit 5.

**All examples are licenced under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/blob/main/LICENSE)**.
