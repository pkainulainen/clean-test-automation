This directory contains the example of the [Introduction to JUnit 5 Test Classes](https://www.cleantestautomation.com/topics/running-junit-5-tests/)  topic of the Introduction to JUnit 5 course. The example projects found from this directory are described in the following:

* The [_introduction-to-test-classes_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/introduction-to-test-classes) 
  directory contains an example application which demonstrates how you can create simple
  test classes and add both setup and teardown methods to your test classes. This example will
  also help you to understand the invocation order of setup, teardown, and test methods.
* The [_introduction-to-nested-test-classes_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/introduction-to-nested-test-classes) 
  directory contains an example application which demonstrates how you can create nested test 
  classes with JUnit 5 and add setup, teardown, and test methods to your nested test classes. 
  This example will also help you to understand the invocation order of setup, teardown, and 
  test methods.
