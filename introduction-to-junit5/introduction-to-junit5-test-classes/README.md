# Introduction to JUnit 5 Test Classes

This directory contains the example projects of the Introduction to JUnit 5 Test Classes 
topic of the [I]ntroduction to JUnit 5 course](https://www.cleantestautomation.com/get-started-with-junit-5/). 
The example projects found from this directory are described in the following:

* The [_introduction-to-test-classes_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/introduction-to-test-classes) 
  directory contains an example project which demonstrates how you can create simple
  test classes and add both setup and teardown methods to your test classes. This example will
  also help you to understand the invocation order of setup, teardown, and test methods.
* The [_introduction-to-nested-test-classes_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/introduction-to-nested-test-classes) 
  directory contains an example project which demonstrates how you can create nested test 
  classes with JUnit 5 and add setup, teardown, and test methods to your nested test classes. 
  This example will also help you to understand the invocation order of setup, teardown, and 
  test methods.
* The [_introduction-to-parameterized-tests_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/introduction-to-parameterized-tests)
  directory contains an example project that demonstrates how you can write your first
  parameterized test with JUnit 5 and customize the display name of each method 
  invocation.
* The [_passing-arguments-to-parameterized-tests_](https://github.com/pkainulainen/clean-test-automation/tree/main/introduction-to-junit5/introduction-to-junit5-test-classes/passing-arguments-to-parameterized-tests)
  directory contains an example project that demonstrates how you can pass arguments to
  your parameterized test method.
