# Running Tests With Gradle

This is the example project of the Running Tests With Gradle lesson of the 
[Introduction to JUnit 5 course](https://www.cleantestautomation.com/get-started-with-junit-5/). 
After you have finished this lesson, you:

* Can get the required dependencies with Gradle.
* Understand how you can use the Gradleâ€™s native JUnit 5 support.
* Can run your tests with Gradle.

When you want to run the tests found from this project, you have to run the
following command at command prompt:

        gradle clean test
