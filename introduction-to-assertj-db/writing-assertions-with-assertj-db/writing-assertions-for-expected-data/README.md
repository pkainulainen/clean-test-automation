# Writing Assertions for the Expected Data

This is an example project of the lessons: Writing Table Level Assertions With AssertJ-DB and
Writing Row Level Assertions With AssertJ-DB of the [Introduction AssertJ-DB course](). After you have finished 
these lessons, you know how you can write your first assertions with AssertJ-DB.

When you want to run the tests found from this example project, you can use this command:

    mvn clean test
