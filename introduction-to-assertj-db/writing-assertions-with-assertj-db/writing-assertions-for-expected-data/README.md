# Writing Assertions for the Expected Data

This is an example project of the lessons: Writing Table Level Assertions With AssertJ-DB and
Writing Row Level Assertions With AssertJ-DB of the [Introduction AssertJ-DB course](). After you have 
finished these lessons, you:

* Understand what a table level assertion is.
* Know what a row level assertion is.
* Understand what kind of table and row level assertions you should write.
* Can write both table and row level assertions with AssertJ-DB.

When you want to run the tests found from this example project, you can use this command:

    mvn clean test
